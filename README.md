# data  
Hello, I'm Alan :) 
I'm a Chemical Engineer, I've been working in the BPO industry for a while as a QA Analyst. 
I've managed to develop myself in data anaylsis and here's my little portfolio that's still growing as I learn more and more.
I've managed to do some projects with python in Jupyter that you can check, I also did 2 data visualizing projects using Microsoft Power BI that I find interesting!
I'm a fast learner, I love digging deep into the data and solve the problems. I still have more things to show and skills to develop :)
